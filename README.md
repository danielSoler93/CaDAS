## Abstract
A long-standing challenge in modelling metalloproteins has been to rapidly define the
binding properties of metallic centres. This task becomes more complex when there is
a lack of empirical structural data. The project reports a dummy-atom-based software
with a time-saving algorithm to determine qualitatively the stability of organometallic
systems. The implementation of this algorithm automatises the parametrization process
for transition metals. The software is tested on a modified carbonic anhydrase and an
artificial metalloprotein. Results of the first test are in agreement with the experimental
data. No binding affinity is found for the second system suggesting the proposed
geometry is implausible. The results show potential applicability of the software in
metalloprotein design.
