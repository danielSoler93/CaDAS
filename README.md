## Abstract
Transition metals are difficult to compute as their electronic rearrangements during simulations
are important to obtain accurate results. Implying not only a big computational
cost but a great time expenditure for all researchers around the world. This is not a
problem if there is time to spare, but certainly, not the most optimum approach for a
first qualitative analysis of a system, where the aim is to look for simplicity and effectiveness
to get some fast insight. This is when Cationic Dummy Atom Software takes a
key role, not just allowing researchers to run a transition metal system simulation within
a day but to obtain some first essential information about their project, also being able
to capture geometry distortion and ligand exchange in the case it occurs.
