## Abstract
The primary goal of this dissertation is to present a new molecular modelling software
to simplify the parametrization of metal centres in metalloproteins. Metal cations are
of relevance in nature as they assist in processes like protein folding or binding to these
folded proteins to tune their properties. Metalloproteins constitute almost half of all
proteins in biology. Understanding the binding affinity and coordination geometry of
metal cofactors would be of great value since it would elucidate mechanisms such as
catalytic processes and signal transduction. This knowledge would also allow for the
design of novel metalloproteins for biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications.
Metalloprotein design is much more challenging than its non metallic counterpart since
metals are much larger and have variable geometries. Metal-binding sights display high
chromaticity, hence they exhibit magnetic properties which in the recent decade have
been characterised through spectroscopic techniques. The implementation of this data
in computation aids advances in representation of metalloprotein structures. This speci-
fity, although yielding accurate results, is not functional due to time expenditure in
cases where qualitative results are desired. In order to abet the process, this project aims
to elaborate a software based on the cationic dummy atom approach. The software will
automate the parametrization of metallic centres,therefore accelerating the representation
of the desired system while determining the stability and geometrical properties at
a reasonable accuracy. The improvement of this software could finally lead to faster but
still accurate predictions for the comprehension of these systems.
